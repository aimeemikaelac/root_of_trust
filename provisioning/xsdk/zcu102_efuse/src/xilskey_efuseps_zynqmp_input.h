* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who     Date     Changes
* ----- ------  -------- ------------------------------------------------------
* 4.0   vns     10/01/15 First release
* 6.0   vns     07/18/16 Removed JTAG user code programming and reading
*                        feature. Modified User FUSE programming, such that
*                        library accepts separate requests for programming
*                        and reading USER FUSES(0 to 7). Provided single bit
*                        programming feature for USER FUSEs.
